                                    However, we have not hosted the National Pedicon since 2004 and it is high time that we

                                    will win the bidding process.</p>

                                Past President Dr. S. Balasankar, President-Elect Dr. A. Somasundaram, Vice President

                            <p>Over the past year, IAP TNSC has witnessed healthy financial growth, largely due to the
                                success of our affiliate programs that continue to engage and attract large audiences.</p>

                            <p>At the same time, we must now turn our focus to strengthening our membership. Building
                                a robust membership baseâ€”particularly from teaching institutionsâ€”can significantly enhance
                                our resources. I humbly request each of you to encourage your residents and postgraduates to join IAP and ensure their transition to Life Members upon course completion.</p>


                            <p>Sustained financial growth will enable us to host high-quality academic events that remain
                                independent and unbiased.</p>

                            <p>I also warmly invite you to Kongu Pedicon 2025, being held in Coimbatoreâ€”a celebration

                            <p><strong>Warm greetings to you.</strong></p>
                            <p>It is both an honour and a privilege to serve as the Academy

                                Dr. K. U. Suresh Balan during his presidency in 2023, has advanced the professional growth of our members. It is truly gratifying to witness its remarkable evolution and continued dedication to academic excellence.

These programs are thoughtfully curated to support postgraduate students and paediatricians across primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare settings.</p>

                                relentless enthusiasm and dedication continue to inspire us. I sincerely hope that his aspirations
                                to serve as the next National President-Elect of IAP will be realized this year.</p>

                            <p>I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Dr. S. Ramesh and his team for
                                successfully organizing the IAP TNSC NextGen Foundation Course for first-year postgraduates
                                at Coimbatore, Trichy, and Pondicherry. Likewise, the POCUS workshop, led by
                                Dr. P.S. Rajakumar, continues to be in high demand and remains an invaluable resource for our
                                community.</p>

                                unwavering commitment and exceptional teamwork. Their dedication is instrumental in driving
                                our collective vision forward.</p>

                            <p>IAP TNSC continues to grow in stature, gaining recognition from government bodies and
                                the broader pediatric community. It is imperative that we build on this momentumâ€”expanding
                                our presence, redefining our roles, and championing initiatives that benefit both our members
                                and society at large.</p>

                            <p>The Annals of Child Health, the official journal of IAP TNSC, is still in its formative phase.
                                I urge members to contribute their research articles, as this publication is on track to become
                                one of the few indexed state IAP journals, strengthening our academic contributions.</p>

                            <p>The One Day One Drug Digest (ODODD), our daily clinical therapeutics digest, has
                                garnered significant attention and is proving to be an invaluable resource for our members. I
                                take immense pride in serving as the managing editor of this pioneering initiative.</p>

                            <p>As we move forward, I reaffirm my commitment to upholding the legacy and expanding the
                                impact of IAP TNSC. I invite each of you to join me in our shared missionâ€”to elevate our
                                organization, foster academic excellence, and establish IAP TNSC as a leading institution in
                                pediatric healthcare.</p>
